Web portfolio developed with **Next.Js** and **Tailwind CSS** to track the progress made over the years in the game and web development. Using **Figma**, I've pondered [some UX options](https://www.figma.com/file/cacW7dvbJnVTpy9Hyp0qUO/EMKORP-draft?node-id=33%3A337) until landing on the one you are reading from. Attached at the bottom is an example of an interface for the projects showcase taken from a first version of the site which was then discarded.
