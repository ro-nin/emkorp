Blog and visual content compendium. First experience with **React** library for creating interfaces. For the content management and back-end I opted for the use of the CMS: **Strapi**. For SEO optimization reasons, after development the project I chose to migrate it to the React Framework: **Next.js**. The blog offers site editors the scaffolding for quick creation of textual content with the WYSIWYG editor integrated into the CMS. Strengthened by the presence of branding through via two main colors, the visual/textual project consists of the website and the linked instagram page, that mirror some of its content.
