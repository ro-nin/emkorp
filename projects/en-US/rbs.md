Developed after completion of the [Web Development Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-6a6736b0-fa00-4f32-89d0-73858b3d1690/), my first experience in full-stack web development with Javascript. The backend was developed with **Node.js**, using a cloud instance of **MongoDB** for persistence, while the front-end client was developed using **Bootstrap**.

It consists of a platform for hosting playful text simulations of games in the vein of *Battle Royale* tropes. The user can create one or more leagues (tournaments) made up of a roster of characters that can be created and customized, and a set of weapons that they will use in the game. The user can then generate games (editions) of the created leagues and share the its results publicly. The simulation of the game is based on a mixture of a basic logic using the character statistics, and an element of randomness (although there is room to extend the complexity of its functioning in the future).

The site was created with the fundamental idea of ​​guaranteeing the persistence of the games played and above all, of the rosters created, since well-known competitors required the creation from scratch (as well as the impossibility of uploading custom images) for each game. Public sharing also allows you to avoid the creation of screenshots, as was usual on other similar platforms in the past.

The effort was mainly directed towards the creation of the back-end, the interface was developed quickly, and will be completely rethought for future versions.
