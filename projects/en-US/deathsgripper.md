Short computer game in the genre of end(less) runners, inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcTVVUFnKQ) of the band Death Grips. My first foray into the game engine **Unity** and into the game development field. The game was developed within two months using free assets found on the web. Since the project comes off as quite ironic, and also since it\'s enjoyable quite only to those who get every obscure reference, I chose at the time the definition of *playable meme*.
